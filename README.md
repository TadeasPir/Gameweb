## Installation of the project:
### Fork the `github/Tadeaspir/gameweb` repo

Once you've found a home for your forked repository, clone it.

## Install

go to / frontend
`` npm i``

if needed, install some dependencies manually with `` npm install {name of dependency} ``

the name of the dependency can be found in error code

now do ``npm run dev`` in terminal inside your frontend and you should see something like this:
```
  VITE v5.2.11  ready in 363 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

```

folow the link.

go to / backend

`` pip install -r dependencies ``

start redis

`` systemctl start redis-server ``

start backend

`` python3 app.py ``

ideally set Debug mode in flask to false and remove strict mode from frontend
